### Sales Overview
In April 2023, we observed a significant increase in both sales (up 20.3% to $24.1K) and quantity (up 19.9% to 6.1K).
Compared to March, two notable trends emerged:
- Weekend Sales: Sales on weekends increased by 7.31 percentage points, from 25.77% in March to 33.08% in April.
- Dark Chocolate Lg: This product experienced a substantial sales boost, rising from $2.9K in March to $3.7K in April, propelling it from the second to the top-selling product.

### Daily Sales Trend
- Daily sales tended to be lower at the beginning and end of the month, with notable peaks of $3.6K on the 2nd and $3K on the 29th, compared to the monthly average of $3.96K
- The highest daily sales were recorded on the 8th and 26th, reaching $4.6K each. Notably, Jamaica Coffee River Lg and Latte consistently ranked among the top-selling products during these peak sales periods.

### Top Products
- Top categories consistence are coffee, tea, bakery and drinking chocolate.
- Dark Chocolate Lg and Substainably Grown Organic Lg are both part of the "Drinking Chocolate" category, which ranks fourth overall. However they have managed to secure the top spots in the overall product sales ranking. That means these two specific products are outstanding and leading the Chocolate drinking category.
- Best Sellers on Weekend are: Ethiopia Rg, Latte, Our Old Time Diner Blend Rg, Traditional Blend Chai Lg, Traditional Blend Chai Rg.

### Sales by Stores and Hours
- All three stores experienced a consistent increase in sales, with Hell's Kitchen slightly outperforming the others, showing a growth of 21.7% ($7.2K).
- Regarding hourly sales patterns, we observed peak performance between 8 AM and 10 AM. During this time, Astonia recorded the lowest sales at $12K, compared to Hell's Kitchen at $17K and Lower Manhattan at $15K.

## Recommendations
**1. Weekend Promotions:** To capitalize on the observed pattern of increased weekend sales, we recommend implementing targeted promotions specifically for our top-selling products on weekends. Prioritize products like Ethiopia Rg, Latte, Our Old Time Diner Blend Rg, and Traditional Blend Chai Lg.  
**2. Highlighting Dark Chocolate Lg and Substainably Grown Organic Lg:** Given their exceptional performance within the "Drinking Chocolate" category, we should actively promote Dark Chocolate Lg and Substainably Grown Organic Lg to customers. These products have demonstrated strong appeal and could further drive sales.  
**3. Addressing Low Sales Periods:** To mitigate the impact of lower sales at the beginning and end of the month, we recommend implementing special promotions during these times. Leveraging our best-selling products could enhance the effectiveness of these promotions.  
**4. Analyzing Astonia's Performance:** Given Astonia's lower sales during peak periods, a more in-depth analysis is warranted. This could involve investigating factors such as product availability, pricing, or store-specific challenges. Based on the findings, we can implement targeted strategies to improve Astonia's performance.
